# Awwwards

## Story

awwwards.com is a meeting point, where digital design professionals from across the globe find inspiration, impart knowledge and experience, connect, and share constructive, respectful critiques.

As you (as a team) browse awwwards.com, you find 3 cool looking loading animation that you want to use in your website also.
The problem is that there is no source code for them, so you need recreate one of them you like the most by seeing the animation.

## What are you going to learn?

- CSS animations
- Animations handling
- Recreate an animation from a website

## Tasks

1. While the content of the page load in, you need to play a loading animation. Create one of the loading animation from the sample sites.
    - There is a loading animation in the page
    - The animation disappears when the page content loaded in

2. Recreate the landing page of the choosen web page. Don't need to create all the elements. You need something to display after the loading.
    - After the animation, a landing page with content in it shows up with animation

## General requirements

- There is a `<div id="root">` tag without children when the page load in
- All the contents are placed and removed by javascript

## Hints

- Try to break up the loading animation's elements to know what you should build in your own animation.
- You can slow down the webpage loading in the DevTools by setup the `Throttling` to `slow 3g` in the `Network` tab.
- If the loading process is to short and you want to see the animation, you can delay functions with `setTimeout()`.
